Command : 
            npm install
            npx create-next-app@latest (create Project with Next.Js)
            npm run dev (to test)

To Use
getStaticProps , getServerSideProps

it can't use in app folder (App Router) because it create for use with (Page Router)
so I create a new folder name Pages (index.js | [id].js)

index.js is a main Page for Display 10 Storys
id.js is a Detail of Story 

Challenge of this test is
- **NO AI!!**
- I never use Next.Js before
- I don't know about getStaticProps , getServerSideProps and this feature in offical website have less example for use
- My tailwind is not working when my pages is outsite of app folder so my solution is comeback to use css (cannot use in App Router)
- I was in backend too long and forgot some front end command so my solution is w3school or css-trick.com
- Many document in internet have example about App Router And that easy to use. But Pages Router is rearly have example to use
- I use Extra time about CSS command and learning about Next JS in offical website **(I think Next.Js that was good so I will Learn more about technical)**
- Loadinng Feature for App Router connot use in Page Router so i fix it by use UseEffect with useRouter
