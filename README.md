Command : 
            npm install
            npx create-next-app@latest (create Project with Next.Js)
            npm run dev (to test)

To Use
getStaticProps , getServerSideProps

it can't use in app folder (App Rounter) because it create for use with (Page Rounter)
so I create a new folder name Pages (index.js | [id].js)

index.js is a main Page for Display 10 Storys
id.js is a Detail of Story 

Challenge of this test is
- I never use Next.Js before i use 1-2 hours to reading a offical website
- I don't know about getStaticProps , getServerSideProps and this command in offical website have less example for use
- My tailwind is not working when my pages is outsite of app folder so my solution is comeback to use css
- I was in backend too long and forgot some front end command so my solution is w3school or css-trick.com
- Many document in internet have example about App Rounter And that easy to use. But Pages Rounter is rearly have example to use
- I use Extra time about CSS command and learning about Next JS (I think Next.Js that was good so I will Learn more) 
- I use Extra time about CSS command and learning about Next JS (I think Next.Js that was good so I will Learn more)
